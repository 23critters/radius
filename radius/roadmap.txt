Road Map
--------

1. Clean up the current code base.

2. Add support for multi-level contexts: tags should be able to be
   defined to only be valid within other sets of tags.

3. Create a simple DSL for defining contexts. I had done some thinking
   about this in the past. This thread on Ruby-Talk defined part of it:

   http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/127640/

   Update: See spec.txt for a fuller explanation of how the DSL should
   behave.

4. Optimize for speed. Incorporate strscan?
