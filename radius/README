= Radius -- Powerful Tag-Based Templates

Radius is a powerful tag-based template language for Ruby inspired by the template languages
used in MovableType <http://www.movabletype.org> and TextPattern <http://www.textpattern.com>.
It uses tags similar to HTML, but can be used to generate any form of plain text (XML, e-mail,
etc...).

== Example

With Radius, it is extremely easy to create custom tags and parse them. Here's a small
example:

  require 'radius'

  # Define tags on a context that will be available in a template:
  context = Radius::Context.new do |c|
    c.define_tag 'hello' do
      'Hello world'
    end
    c.define_tag 'repeat' do |tag|
      number = (tag.attr['times'] || '1').to_i
      result = ''
      number.times { result << tag.expand }
      result
    end
  end
  
  # Create a parser to parse tags that begin with 'r:'
  parser = Radius::Parser.new(context, :tag_prefix => 'r')
  
  # Parse tags and output the result
  puts parser.parse(%{A small example:\n<r:repeat times="3">* <r:hello />!\n</r:repeat>})
  
Output:

  A small example:
  * Hello world!
  * Hello world!
  * Hello world!
