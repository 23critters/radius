= Radius -- Powerful Tag-Based Templates

Radius is a small, but powerful template language for Ruby inspired by the template languages
used in MovableType <http://www.movabletype.org> and TextPattern <http://www.textpattern.com>.
It uses tags similar to HTML, but can be used to generate any form of plain text (XML, e-mail,
etc...).


== Download

The latest version of Radius can be found on RubyForge:

http://rubyforge.org/projects/radius/


== Installation

It is recommended that you install Radius using the RubyGems packaging system:

  % gem install --remote radius

You can also install Radius by copying lib/radius.rb into the Ruby load path.

== License

Radius is free software and may be redistributed under the same terms and Ruby itself. For
more details, see the readme file in the Ruby distribution.
