= Change Log

* Many refactorings of the Context object and unit tests.
* Created a DSL for defining tags (introducing a DSL means that the old way of defining tags is obsolete,
  meaning that this version of Radius is incompatible with the last).
* Updated documentation to reflect the changes.

=== 0.0.2
* Refactored Parser to use Context#render_tag instead of #send when rendering tags defined on a Context.
* UndefinedTagError is now thrown when Parser tries to render a tag which doesn't exist on a Context.
* Added Context#tag_missing which works like method_method missing on Object, but is tag specific.

=== 0.0.1
* First release.
