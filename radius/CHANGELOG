= Change Log

* Refactored Parser to use Context#render_tag instead of #send when rendering tags defined on a Context.
* UndefinedTagError is now thrown when Parser tries to render a tag which doesn't exist on a Context.
* Added Context#tag_missing which works like method_method missing on Object, but is tag specific.

=== 0.0.1
* First release.
