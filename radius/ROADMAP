= Roadmap

This is a prioritized roadmap for future releases:

1. Clean up the current code base. [Done]

2. Add support for multi-level contexts: tags should be able to be
   defined to only be valid within other sets of tags. [Done]

3. Create a simple DSL for defining contexts. I had done some thinking
   about this in the past. This thread on Ruby-Talk defined part of it:

   http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/127640/

   Update: See link:files/DSL-SPEC.html for a fuller explanation of how
   the DSL might behave.
   
   [In progress]

4. Optimize for speed. Incorporate strscan?
